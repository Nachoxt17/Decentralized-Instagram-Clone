+-Decentralized Finance Ethereum Version of Instagram. You can connect your Metamask Wallet, upload an Image wich Post(Name and Description) will be saved in an Web Server BUT
the Image itself will be saved in a Descentrilized InterPlanetary File System(I.P.F.S.). Posts in the DApp can Tipped with Ethereum wich will go to Post Owners's Wallets.

To build this I used OpenZeppelin Contracts Library to make the development faster and safer and I made Unit Testing with Mocha & Chai.
